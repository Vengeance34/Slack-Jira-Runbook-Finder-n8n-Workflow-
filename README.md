# Slack-Jira-Runbook-Finder-n8n-Workflow-

This project is an n8n automation workflow that listens to Slack messages, searches Jira issues based on message text, and extracts the first runbook/SOP URL found in the Jira ticket description—even if the description is in Atlassian’s complex rich-text (ADF) storage format.
